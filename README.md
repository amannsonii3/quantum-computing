# Quantum Computing with Qiskit

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks exploring quantum computing concepts using IBM's Qiskit framework.

## How is it different from the IBM coursework available on YoutTube:

Recreated the tutorial from scratch adding informations and comments along the way which I found difficult to interpret as a Chemistry student curious to learn an apply quantum computing for DFT.

Hope this helps you too!

## Notebooks

### 1. `ep2_Installation.ipynb`
- Qiskit installation and setup
- Environment configuration

### 2. `ep3_Not_So_HelloWorld.ipynb`  
- Spoiler Alert: We do everything BUT print "Hello World".
- IBM orignal notebook just assumes you know most of the stuff and skips to the setup


## Requirements

```
qiskit
qiskit-ibm-runtime
qiskit-aer
matplotlib
numpy
```

## Hardware

Experiments are designed to run on:
- IBM Quantum simulators (Aer)
- IBM Quantum real hardware (127-qubit processors)
